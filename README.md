I wanted a simple interior for the Ammunation near PDM with an enterable office for a player ownable Ammunation. Couldn't find one, so I threw one together.<br />

Throw bb-ammunation into your resources folder<br />
ensure bb-ammunation in your server cfg<br />
or throw it in your mapping folder thats already ensured/started.<br />

tested in my server. Collision is fine. Not perfect but good enough.<br />
My codewalker shows the collision as being messed up though, so if it doesn't work on for someone I'll just redo the collision<br />
