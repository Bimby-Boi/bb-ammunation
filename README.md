I wanted a simple interior for the Ammunation near PDM with an enterable office for a player ownable Ammunation. Couldn't find one, so I threw one together.<br />

Throw bb-ammunation into your resources folder<br />
ensure bb-ammunation in your server cfg<br />
or throw it in your mapping folder thats already ensured/started.<br />

tested in my server. Collision is fine. Not perfect but good enough.<br />
My codewalker shows the collision as being messed up though, so if it doesn't work on for someone I'll just redo the collision<br />

I didn't add lighting to the office. <br />
theres no lighting in there as _technically_ you're not supposed to enter there.<br />
I didn't add them. If you want them add them yourself.<br />
