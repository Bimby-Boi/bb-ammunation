I wanted a simple interior for the Ammunation near PDM with an enterable office for a player ownable Ammunation. Couldn't find one, so I threw one together.

Throw bb-ammunation into your resources folder
ensure bb-ammunation in your server cfg
or throw it in your mapping folder thats already ensured/started.

tested in my server. Collision is fine. Not perfect but good enough.
My codewalker shows the collision as being messed up though, so if it doesn't work on for someone I'll just redo the collision
